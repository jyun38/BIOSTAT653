# BIOSTAT653
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of moderate and high intensity exercise training on whole-body insulin sensitivity in obese adults in the absence of weight loss. The basic design of the study involved recruiting 31 sedentary obese adults between the ages of 18 and 40 and randomly assigning them to either moderate or intense exercise. Subjects were tightly monitored and consulted to maintain their body weight throughout the intervention. The study results showed that average insulin sensitivity significantly changed over the three visits (p = 0.0020), for a typical individual with average fat mass and muscle glycogen, after adjusting for sex. Average insulin sensitivity on Visit 2 was significantly different than average insulin sensitivity on Visit 1 for a typical individual with average fat mass and muscle glycogen (p = 0.0005), after adjusting for sex. But, average insulin sensitivity on Visit 3 was not significantly different than average insulin sensitivity on Visit 2 (p = 0.1836) and was not significantly different compared to Visit 1 (p = 0.0977). However, there was no significant difference in insulin sensitivity between exercise groups.
